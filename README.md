# Dungeon Master's Toolkit
## Dungeon Master's Toolkit - or DMT for short - will be a cross-platform (Linux, Mac, and Windows) program that allows people to streamline various annoying things that you have to do when running a D&D session.
### We have many things we want to do with DMT, including but not limited to (as we may add on more functionality later):
#### * Allow the DM to host games that the players connect to so they can be up to date on various information as the session continues
#### * Track useful bookkeeping information such as Health, Armor Class, Movement, Size, and number of spell slots. Additionally, it will allow for modification of said information (Only the DM will be able to monitor ALL information and modify said information, players can only see their own groups' Health, Armor Class, Movement/Speed and Size as well as the enemies' size.) As was implied above the DM can add/deduct health points from any entity. Add/remove status effects from any entity, and can add/remove any given entity from the turn order at any time (e.g., if a player or enemy dies during combat, or a new enemy joins the fray)
#### * Track turn order
#### * Track what “things” have been done this turn and what is left (i.e., if a player or enemy has an action, movement, bonus action left this turn)
#### * Holds Monster and Player Information for ease of access and setup ~ Anyone can modify their own database but only the DM’s database will be used for the game session to draw information from. We will provide an easy way for the users to add onto, remove or update things on this database. This database of monsters where the DM can quickly grab information on any official monsters/enemies or homebrewed material they have access to will hold the following only for now: Health, AC, Movement, Size (perhaps we'll add Initiative Bonus in the future as well)
#### * A chatbox for players to do things like roll dice, discuss things in their session, place links, and drop files (file sharing through here will likely be implemented in the distant future however as it is not a priority due to most users likely using things like Discord to talk or being physically around one another)
#### Eventually we would like to provide a staging feature similar to what roll20 has where the DM can set up combat encounters in advance so they can easily bring them up when the time comes. We would also like to add in saving game states (so you can pick up where you leave off on your session some other time) at some point but that will probably be kinda far off in the future.
#### We will also try to provide some basic documentation on how to use the program.
